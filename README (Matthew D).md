# Project Summary: Matthew Denholm

Students:
1. Matthew Denholm
2. Nic Crombie
3. Caroline Reed

Objective:<br>
The main objective of this project was to create the back-end database side of a website for a client. It was for a program called TWIST (Teen Women In Science and Technology), a one-day conference to expose teen women across the state to various career possibilities. The overall end goal was to create a website/application that allows students to sign-up for sessions of their interest, and have a schedule be generated to best fit the interests of all the students.

My Contributions:<br>
I contributed a lot all over the place on the website, but the majority was on creating controllers and standardizing models. The major ones I worked on were School, Session, and Schedule. The second majority were the room and topic models and controllers (these were done after the completion of the School and Session tasks). I also contributed to the layout of the web pages, particularly the same ones as the major three I worked on (School, session, and Schedule). I did minor corrections and improvements in the other tasks throughout the project when asked or needed as well.

Challenges:
1. Lack of the code understanding. This was my first semester with javascript, and I know this was the hardest challenge of the project; figuring out how the code works. There were many times I had to ask for help on understanding the code because the syntax and layout of the language feels much different from the other languages I have worked with in the past. Understanding how code in different locations connects and intertwines with data from other locations was definitely a stretch for me on this project.
2. Design. I don't mean design in front-end design, I mean format of data design and how that data interacts with other data. Being able to understand how this was supposed to interact was a challenge that didn't show itself in full until midway thorugh the project. Re-analyzing the table connections made this more clear.
3. Data feeding. Taking data from the database and displaying it properly on the webpage wasn't the hardest part of the project, but still a challenge. This was often eventually tackled with some documentation and experimentation of word choice.

Incomplete Features:<br>
Probably a decent list of immediate things that are incomplete. Many more to improve upon.
1. The Schedule reads data, but is not in a usuable format.
2. Participant and Presenter sign-up reads data from topics, but is unable to store that data in its own Schematic
3. School codes do not directly coorelate with participants in the program.

Improvements to be made:
1. The home page needs more design asthetics.
2. Form fields would have better sanitize checks
3. Schedule wouldn't be a schematic, rather a hub collection where all data from the database is shown in an orderly manner. (This is somewhat the case when you visit the schedule page)
4. Current Models need object references to other models
5. Deployed version retrieves an error upon creation in some models. This didn't seem to be the case in the development version, but things happen.

Project Reflection:<br>
Being this was the first time working on the back-end side of things, the project turned out better than I was initially thinking. If I were to try this project again from scratch, the first thing I would do is better understand the connections between the data and how its going to be used/displayed. Starting this project I didn't fully grasp how many connections were needed to make everything work together. I would also reconsider which parts work with each other and stick with one chunk at a time. Working in a group the same thing would apply, the differences being improving communication and how tasks are assigned. Those are the main things I would do differently if this projet were to be retackled.
