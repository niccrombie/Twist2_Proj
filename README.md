# TWIST_Project <br>
The website/database project for CMST 283 at KSU Salina <br><br>
11.8.2018<br>
Nicholas Crombie-<br> initiated express/node/mongoose packets, models built. I started building the controllers and will presume they will use basic CRUD functions in all models. need to check with Kyler/Tom about whether controllers will be necessary for all models/relations. need to check with kyler/tom or troy about relational data.<br><br>

11.26.18
Matthew Denholm-<br> Session controller should have basic CRUD functionality. Views need to be hooked up still to confirm this.

12.04.18
Matthew Denholm-<br> Session and Participant are fully functional on CRUD. Can be prettied up later.

Nicholas Crombie-<br>
with Matthew Denholm & Caroline Reed<br><br>
PURPOSE:<br>
  The purpose of this project was to create a system that will handle the K-State twist registration and scheduling. Students would register for topics they are interested in and systematically fill in registered students into the scheduled sessions based on their interest.<br><br>
FEATURES:<br>
  Ability for students and presenters to register with their topics of interest or professional background. Have the ability to view the upcoming schedule.<br><br>
DESIGN DECISION:<br>
  We started off with basic layout but never really got to explore design with the project. We did decide on how to layout schedule on a table with columns being Sessions vertically, and the rooms being horizontal rows. This would allow the administrator to get a good layout of what was being presented, and who was presenting to maybe modify it so that the sessions can stay in certain rooms and presenters wouldn't have to move around as much from one room to another.<br><br>
PROBLEMS/CHALLENGES:<br>
  The personal challenges I had was understanding the code at first, this being the first opportunity to type out the code and build it from the ground up we made some pretty good early decision with naming convention and organization was on point in our group. We all understood what we were trying to accomplish and everytime we ran into an issue we figured it out, or asked for help as soon as it was necessary. <br><br>
  The biggest issue I feel was conceptualizing what i needed. Later after the presentation I realized my fault was not starting at the basic psuedo code and writing it out on paper what had to be done to make it happen, slowly translating that into code that could be used and work.<br><br>
INCOMPLETE/NEED IMPROVEMENTS:<br>
  This project is far from complete, and I could easily pour another 20 hours into just the backend before it's working stable. I would have liked to set it up with user/admin routes, and then of course finish the updates and creates so that the checkboxes, and drop down fields would function and show up in the detail pages, it was just an issue with either the controller not sending that information to details, or the names are possible not exactly the same. The Schedule is a challenge in it self and would of course liked that have presented that with functional drop downs and get a user page set up to view it but not have the drop downs.<br><br>
  REFLECTIONS:<br>
    Next time I would probably spend more time in the early stages asking more questions about what the end product should be what order would have been best to approach the project, the more time we spend understanding what needs to happen to get a final product we could have better mapped out our project. Keeping track of time spent on it could have been good and possibly monitor progress with each log to see if one stratagy worked over another if times is been used efficiently. I enjoyed the group aspect and being able to present it and would not have changed anything there. I deffinetly feel the project was a challenge and I learned a lot from it and feel it's a perfect blend for studio/progII/VisualLit if given the right amount of time a project like that could have been used as a final presentation for all 3 classes.
